# Pretrained_tensorflow
Implementation of how to use pretrained model in a simple way for transfer learning vision tasks

This reposiotiry has an example of using Rock-Scissor-Paper dataset.

Obtain the train data  from  https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps.zip and unzip,
Obtain the test data from https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-test-set.zip and unzip.

In this repo I have showed how to include augumentation pipeline with ImageDataGenerator in a simple way    
as well as how to use callbacks.  

Provide the path of train and test data and pretrained weights in main.py and run main.py
